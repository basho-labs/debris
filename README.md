riak-c-client
=============


# Status

This is a **basho-labs** project, therefore it is NOT ready to use in a production environment. Once we feel the project has become stable, we'll move it to the [Basho](https://github.com/basho) Github org. The project will then be renamed to `riak-c-client`.
